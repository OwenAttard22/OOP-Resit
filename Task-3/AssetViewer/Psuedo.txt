Pseudo Code for what AssetViewer could've been:
Assumption: We are re-using the Test.proto used for Task3a and Task3b found in Java/oopresit/task3/src/main/proto

Initialise empty ArrayList of type Assets

Get All list of saved assets.bin files in Java/oopresit/task3
If list is empty: 
    print empty message
Otherwise: 
    continue

Iterate over length of saved files
    Print loop counter alongside filename for CLI Menu
Take user input for file selection

Read Assets_Proto from file
Iterate over Asset in Assets_Proto, for each Asset:
    if Asset type is Stock_Proto:
        use Assets.get_intermediary() to get intermediary
        use getters to retrieve intermediary Name and Commission
        construct Broker
        use Asset getters to retrieve Name, Value, Yield, Quantity, Ticker
        construct Stock
        append Stock to the global ArrayList

    if Asset type is Bond_Proto:
        use Assets.get_intermediary() to get intermediary
        use getters to retrieve intermediary Name and interestRate
        construct Bank
        use Asset getters to retrieve Name, Value, InterestRate, DaysToMaturity
        construct Bond
        append Bond to global ArrayList
        

    if Asset type is MutualFund_Proto:
        use Assets.get_intermediary() to get intermediary
        use getters to retrieve intermediary Name, EmployeeNumber and ManagementFee
        construct MutualFundManager
        use Asset getters to retrieve Name, Value and ExpenseRatio
        construct MutualFund
        append MutualFund to global ArrayList


iterate over Asset in global ArrayList, for each Asset:
    print Asset
