# OOP-Resit

This is my github repository for the CPS2004- Object Oriented Programming Assignment - September Session

All Java related tasks are created as modules to a parent project called oopresit. Each sequential task is dependent on the previous module's pom.xml file allowing for better file sharing. The multi-module Maven project is found in the Java/oopresit directory, within this directory you can find the parent pom.xml file and all module folders: task1, task2, task3 and task4.

## Task 1

Task 1 is split into 3 parts:
    1. UML Diagram which is found in the report
    2.[Java Implementation](#java-implementation) 
    3. [C++ Implementation](#c-implementation)

### Java Implementation

The Java implementation of task 1 is found in Java/oopresit/task1/

### C++ Implementation

## Task 2

The Java implementation of task 2 is found in Java/oopresit/task2/

## Task 3

The Java implementation of task 3 is found in Java/oopresit/task3/

## Task 4

The Java implementation of task 4 is found in Java/oopresit/task4/, this implemtation consists of Task 4-A and Task 4-B
